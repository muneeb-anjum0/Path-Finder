# Path Finder (OpenGL)

A modern C++ application for visualizing and experimenting with pathfinding algorithms in real time, using OpenGL for rendering and ImGui for a user-friendly interface. Built for education, experimentation, and demonstration.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Step through pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, and more).
- **Intuitive GUI:** Built with ImGui and GLFW for easy interaction.
- **Customizable Grid:** Set grid size, obstacles, and start/end points visually.
- **Real-Time Controls:** Pause, resume, step, and reset the algorithm at any time.
- **Cross-Platform Ready:** Designed for Windows, easily portable to other platforms.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++17 or later
- OpenGL-compatible GPU and drivers
- All dependencies (GLFW, GLAD, ImGui, GLM, stb_image) are included in `include/` and `lib/`

### Build & Run

**Recommended (VS Code):**
1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Use the build task: `C/C++: gcc.exe build OpenGL` (Ctrl+Shift+B).
3. Run the app with the `Run OpenGL` task or double-click `OpenGL.exe`.

**Manual (MSYS2/MinGW Example):**
```sh
C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\g++.exe -fdiagnostics-color=always -g src/main.cpp src/glad.c src/imgui.cpp src/imgui_draw.cpp src/imgui_tables.cpp src/imgui_widgets.cpp src/imgui_demo.cpp src/imgui_impl_glfw.cpp src/imgui_impl_opengl3.cpp -o OpenGL.exe -Iinclude -Iinclude/imgui -Llib -lglfw3dll -lopengl32
```

## üïπÔ∏è Controls
- Use the GUI to set start/end points, place obstacles, and select algorithms.
- Step, pause, or reset the visualization as needed.
